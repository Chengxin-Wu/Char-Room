# Char-Room
a simple unencrypted instant messenger: BasicIM.  BasicIM consists of two parts: a single instance of a server (server.py) and a variable number of BasicIM clients (client.py).  Each client connects to the server, the latter of which is responsible for receiving instant messages from a client and echoing those messages to all other connected clients.  (The client that sent the message doesn't receive a copy of it.)  In other words, BasicIM provides group chat, similar to IRCLinks to an external site., and uses TCP socketsLinks to an external site. to communicate.
